# üöÄ FicZon Inc. - Sales Effectiveness Optimization

This project is focused on enhancing lead conversion strategies for **FicZon Inc.** by leveraging machine learning and neural networks to classify leads into **High Potential** and **Low Potential** categories.

## üìå Business Case

FicZon Inc. wants to improve its sales conversion rates by prioritizing leads that are more likely to convert. Traditional sales methods result in wasted time and effort on low-quality leads. This project provides a data-driven solution to predict lead quality and guide the sales team to focus on what matters most.

### ‚ú® Goals

- Classify leads into High Potential or Low Potential.
- Build predictive models based on historical sales data.
- Enable the sales team to focus efforts efficiently.
- Improve conversion rates and revenue.

## üìä Dataset & Tools

- **Database**: MySQL (remote connection)
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `sklearn` (SVM, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, Evaluation)
  - `keras`, `tensorflow` (Neural Network)
  - `sqlalchemy` (for DB connection)

## üß™ Approach

### 1. Data Extraction
- Connected securely to a MySQL database.
- Fetched relevant tables including lead attributes and outcomes.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.
- Performed encoding for categorical features.
- Scaled numeric values for neural network training.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions.
- Analyzed lead conversion rates and feature impact.
- Identified correlations.

### 4. Model Building
- Trained multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Deep Neural Network (using Keras/TensorFlow)
- Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 5. Best Model Selection
- Compared all models.
- Neural Network achieved the best performance on classification metrics.

---

## ‚úÖ Results

- The Neural Network achieved **high accuracy** in classifying lead potential.
- Improved the targeting strategy for sales by identifying high-value leads early.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Data Integration**: Establishing secure and stable database connection.
- **Data Quality**: Cleaning inconsistencies and missing entries.
- **Model Interpretability**: Neural networks are black boxes, requiring extra effort for stakeholder explanation.
- **Bias Handling**: Ensuring fairness in classification of leads to avoid missing good opportunities.
